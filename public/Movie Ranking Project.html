     <h1 class="title1">Best Movies That I Watched</h1>
     <h2 class="title1">Here are the list;</h2>

     <ol>
     <li>
        <h3>Sherlock</h3>
        <p>Sherlock is one of the most beautiful Tv show of all time that I watched. It has 13 episode, one episode is filler but its amazing too, every episode feels like a new cinema film and it really shows the hard work that put in each episode by the director and actors.</p>
     </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
      <p>Attack on Titan is the first anime that I watched and it was awesome. It has a uniqe and different style compared to the other animes and it expresses the idea it wants to express very well and fluently. I don't want to talk about it much but if you haven't watched it or if you haven't watched any anime at all, I recommend you to watch it.</p>
      </li>
    <li>
    <h3>After Life</h3>
    <p>After life is a movie about a depressed and suicidal guy that lost his wife to the cancer. This movie shows that depression can be cured and you can defeat the suicide urge and reintegrate to the society. If you are depressed and always on a bad mood, I really recommend you to watch this movie. </p>
